			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this website is to provide a simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that demonstrates core web development skills including HTML layout, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity. It allows users to play against another person on the same device.</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The primary audience is casual users, students, or friends who want to play a quick game. It's also designed for instructors or classmates reviewing the project as part of WDD 131, showcasing web development proficiency.</p>

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>JavaScript will be used to add interactivity and game logic, including detecting player turns, checking for win or draw conditions, displaying game results, and allowing users to reset the game. The script will also dynamically update the game board as players click on the cells, providing immediate feedback without page reloads.</p>
